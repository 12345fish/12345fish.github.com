		["<p>When it comes to explaining philosophy,  sometimes less is more — and we think this arresting collection of minimalist  posters encompasses that idea perfectly.<br />  The illustrations you see featured below  are from a a series entitled &quot;Philographics,&quot; and were created by  London-based graphic designer Genís Carreras. Using basic colors, simple  geometric design, and concise definitions, Carreras manages to cram impressive  amounts of information — on philosophical doctrines as diverse as hedonism,  determinism, and existentialism — into a surprisingly simple and accessible  package.<br />  We've included a sample of the collection  below, but you'll find the series in its entirety, along with plenty more  examples of Carreras' work, over on his website. The posters are also available  for purchase via society6.<br />  All descriptions have been transcribed from  their respective posters ","  Existentialism <br />  Individual is solely responsible for giving  his or her own life meaning and for living that life passionately and  sincerely, dealing with his or her conditions, emotions, actions,  responsibilities, and thoughts.","  Idealism<br />  Experience is ultimately based on mental  activity. It is contrasted with realism, in which the external world is said to  have an apparent absolute existence. The only things which can be directly  known for certain are just ideas.","  Realism<br />  Reality exists independently of observers.  In ethics, moral realism takes the view that there are objective moral values.  Representative realism claims that humans cannot perceive the external world  directly.","  Empiricism<br />  Knowledge arises from evidence gathered via  sense experience. Empiricism emphasizes the role of experience and evidence,  especially sensory perception, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of  innate ideas or tradition."," Deism<br />  Reason and observation of the natural  world, without the need for organised religion, can determine that a supreme  being created the universe. This deity does not intervene in human affairs or  suspend the natural laws of the universe."," Humanism<br />  Human being can lead happy and functional  lives, and are capable of being ethical and moral, without religion or dogma.  Life stance emphasises the unique responsibility facing humanity and the  ethical consequences of human decisions.","  Dualism<br />  Mind and matter are fundamentally distinct  kinds of substances. Human beings have both of them, mind or soul and body.  Moral dualism is the belief of the greater complement or conflict between the  good and the evil.","  Hedonism<br />  Pleasure is the only intrinsic good.  Actions can be evaluated in terms of how much pleasure they produce. In very  simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize the pleasure and minimize the  pain."," Absolutism<br />  An absolute truth is always correct under  any condition. An entity's ability to discern these things is irrelevant to  that state of truth. Universal facts can be discovered. It is opposed to  relativism, which claims that there is not an unique truth."," Relativisim<br />  Points of view have no absolute truth or  validity, having only relative, subjective value according to differences in  perception and consideration. Principles and ethics are regarded as aplicable  in only limited context."," Free will<br />  Agents have the ability to make choices.  Individuals can be held morally accountable for their actions. An omnipotent  divinity does not assert its power over the will and choices of individuals.","Determinism<br />  Events within a given paradigm are bound by  causality in such a way that any state of an object or event is determined by  prior states. Every type of event, including human cognition (behaviour,  decision, and action), is causally determined by previous events.","  Nihilism.<br />Life is without objective meaning, purpose,  or intrinsic value. Morality does not inherently exist and any established  moral values are abstractly contrived. Knowledge is not possible and some  aspects of reality do not exist as such.</p>"]

		["<p>We consider the ability to manage a team so  important that, in a recent book, we made it one of the &ldquo;3 Imperatives for  Becoming a Great Leader:&rdquo; Manage Your Team — the first imperative — is about  creating a real team and managing through it. For the record, the other two  imperatives are Manage Yourself — which is about building relationships based  on trust, not authority — and Manage Your Network, which is about connecting  and collaborating with those you don&rsquo;t control.</p><p>&ldquo;Manage your team&rdquo; might seem clear and straightforward. Yet when we  talk about it, we often find it&rsquo;s not an intuitive concept for many managers  and for some it even cuts against the grain of what they think they should do  as bosses.</p><p>Perhaps the easiest way to explain the  problem, as we&rsquo;ve come to understand it, is through the phrase we used above —  manage &ldquo;through the team.&rdquo; By that we mean you should use the social dynamics  of the team to manage individual members, rather than managing members primarily  one-by-one. This is a critical distinction that many managers miss. Though they  extol the benefits of teamwork, they insist on managing their teams  individual-by-individual. Thus, they virtually ensure that their groups will  never become true teams.</p>","<p>Every group is not a team. Most are not, in  fact, and so it&rsquo;s good to start with a definition.<br />  A team is a group of people who do  collective work and are mutually committed to a common team purpose and  challenging goals related to that purpose.</p><p>Teams are more productive and innovative  than mere work groups. They produce results that exceed what groups of  individuals can do through simple cooperation and coordination. Such results  reflect a &ldquo;team effect:&rdquo; members perform better when they feel they&rsquo;re part of a  team. The root of this benefit is members&rsquo; strong mutual commitment to their  joint work. This commitment creates compelling social and emotional bonds among  members, who come to believe that &ldquo;we&rdquo; will all succeed or fail together and  that no one can succeed if the team fails. In every team, &ldquo;we&rdquo; trumps &ldquo;I.&rdquo;  Unless you&rsquo;ve been part of a team yourself, it&rsquo;s hard to understand the  exhilaration produced by this sense of what &ldquo;we&rdquo; can accomplish together.</p><p>This mutual commitment, this &ldquo;we,&rdquo; the  potent interpersonal bonds among team members, spring from two related sources:</p><p>A mutual sense of purpose. Every  high-performing team believes it exists for a compelling reason and that the  world will be better for what it does. Its purpose is not the task or work it  does but the benefit it delivers. It&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;We scrub  hospital floors&rdquo; and &ldquo;We prevent the spread of deadly infections.&rdquo; This is what  pulls people together and makes them feel part of something bigger than  themselves.Tangible goals based on that purpose.  Purpose must be made concrete or it will quickly wither. To sustain its sense  of purpose, every team needs to strive toward specific, real achievements that  will fulfill that purpose.<br />  In short, purpose and related goals are the  glue that holds a team together. Purpose without concrete goals is just a  dream. Goals without purpose are aimless activity. But although they are  critical, purpose and goals are not enough. A team also needs clarity. In  particular, team members need clarity about:</p><p>Members&rsquo; roles and responsibilities — not  everyone can do everything<br />  Important work processes — the way the team  does its work, such as making decisions<br />  Values, norms, and standards that define  what members expect of each other — how conflict, for example, may and may not  be expressed<br />  The kinds of feedback and metrics needed to  measure progress.<br />  These may be the more nitty-gritty aspects  of team infrastructure but they&rsquo;re needed to keep the team&rsquo;s work flowing  smoothly and to minimize destructive conflict. And when all these conditions  are present and a group becomes a true team, members perform at a high level  not because the boss demands it but because their team colleagues expect it.  Members work hard so as to support each other and not let the team down. In  effect, then, the team manages itself. If a team member fails to perform, other  members will let him know. In this way, performance is guided by the social and  emotional bonds among members, not the expectations of the boss. When this  occurs, the manager is managing through the team by using the social bonds  among members to shape behavior.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a more effective way to manage because  it elicits more commitment and effort from the individuals involved. But it&rsquo;s  obviously not a comfortable approach for those bosses who need to be &ldquo;in  charge&rdquo; and want to believe that their team will succeed because of their  direct influence. They dislike, in particular, the fact that creating a team  requires such an indirect approach, like a pool player making a bank shot off  the side rather than straight into a pocket. They don&rsquo;t realize that the more  direct approach they prefer will most likely prevent their group from becoming  a real team. Real teams emerge spontaneously when the right conditions are  present; a team can&rsquo;t be created by decree. The boss cannot dictate a  compelling purpose; the team members must choose one, though it certainly can  be one the boss has suggested and the team discussed.</p><p>Thus, instead of imposing and directing,  you as group leader must suggest, support, define, focus on, talk about,  expect, hire for, lead discussions about, and evaluate performance against the  conditions that foster the spontaneous formation of a team. Your formal  authority can be useful for directing people&rsquo;s time and attention to the right  issues and conditions. That&rsquo;s far from nothing, but in the end only your  group&rsquo;s members can make themselves into a team by freely committing themselves  to a mutual purpose.</p><p>Your job as team leader is to foster and  then sustain the conditions that help them do that. You may not feel completely  comfortable with such an indirect approach, but that&rsquo;s how teams work.</p>"] //3
